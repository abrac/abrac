### Hi there / Howzit / Hoe gaan dit / Molweni / നമസ്ക്കരം 👋

I'm a Mechatronics Engineer, hailing from the Eastern Cape in South Africa. My research is focussed on the Electric Vehicles, and I am currently investigating the feasibility of *electrifying* minibus taxis in Sub-Saharan Africa.

My favourite programming languages:
- Python
- C# (but learning Vala)
- GNU Octave

I'm also a GNU/Linux enthusiast. I hope free-software can be the norm -- for the sake of making computers and software more accessible to the underpriveleged.

I'm currently doing my Master's Degree in Stellenboch University. Please contact me if you would like to collaborate or find out more about my research.

⚡ Fun fact: My home language is Malayalam (say that aloud, it's fun).
